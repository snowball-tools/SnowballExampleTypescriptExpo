# Example Typescript React Native Expo App

Spent a few hours on throwing an cross platform ios, android, and web app together using [Expo](https://expo.io/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

This is not designed to be a production app, but rather a quick example with localization, navigation, and a few other things.

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
```

### Linting

using [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io), set rules at `.eslintrc.js`

```bash
yarn eslint .
```

## Usage

To run the app in development mode, use:

```bash
yarn start
```

Then open the Expo client app on your phone and scan the QR code. You can also use an Android or iOS simulator on your computer.
